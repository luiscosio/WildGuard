\section{Ethical Considerations}
DarkPatternMonitor relies on publicly available, opt-in datasets (WildChat and DarkBench) and does not ingest private or proprietary conversations. The WildChat dataset is anonymized and keyed by conversation identifiers without personal data. The system is intended for AI safety research, auditing, and transparency reporting, not for surveillance of individual users or punitive actions without consent.

We emphasize that labeling and classification may encode cultural and linguistic biases, and that false positives can stigmatize benign interactions. The project documentation recommends human review for high-confidence detections and clear disclosure when monitoring is deployed in production systems.
