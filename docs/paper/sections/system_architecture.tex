\section{System Architecture}
DarkPatternMonitor is organized as a modular pipeline with well-separated stages for data ingestion, labeling, modeling, inference, and reporting. Figure~\ref{fig:architecture} depicts the end-to-end architecture used in the repository.

Key architectural properties include: (i) streaming ingestion with checkpointing for large datasets, (ii) parallel LLM calls for judge labeling and elicitation, (iii) a fast embedding classifier for batch inference, and (iv) analytics modules that reuse shared JSONL outputs. A lightweight Streamlit app provides interactive access to detections and reports without coupling to the core pipeline.
