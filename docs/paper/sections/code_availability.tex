\section{Code Availability}
All code referenced in this paper is contained in the DarkPatternMonitor repository. Core entrypoints are provided via \texttt{src/} modules (ingestion, elicitation, judging, training, inference, and analytics), with a Streamlit demo in \texttt{app/streamlit\_app.py}. Dependencies are specified in \texttt{requirements.txt} and \texttt{pyproject.toml}. The README documents how to download pre-trained models and outputs when available; these artifacts are not bundled in this Overleaf package.
